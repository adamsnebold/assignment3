 * You should reverse the linked list and return the new "first" pointer.  The reversal

 * Params:
 *   first - a pointer to the first node of a singly-linked list to be reversed
 *
 * Return:
 *   Should return the new first of the reversed list.  If first is NULL, this
 *   function should return NULL.
